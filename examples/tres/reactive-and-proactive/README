= Reactive and proactive TRes example

This folder contains an example showing the reactive behaviour of reactive (GET based) TRes
and its interaction with the regular (OBSERVE based) behaviour.

The simulation runs 3 simple TRes nodes and automatically sets up the Halve task
(https://github.com/tecip-nes/contiki-tres/wiki/The-Halve-Task-Example).

== Prerequisites

To use the client-test.sh script you will need libcoap client supporting COAP13.

== How to run it:

Launch the simulation in Cooja (the Halve task will be automatically set up)
    $ make TARGET=cooja tres-test-src.csc >/dev/null

Open a different terminal and tunslip6
    $ make connect-router-cooja

Open a third terminal to simulate the client:
    $ ./client-test.sh get 

Now activate the task and notice that the GET on /no has become METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED:
    $ ./client-test.sh toggle
    $ ./client-test.sh get

You can also use Copper to test out the /no subresource and its behaviour.
