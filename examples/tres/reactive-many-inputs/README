= Reactive TRes with many inputs example

This folder contains an example showing the reactive behaviour of reactive (GET based) TRes
when the task has more than one input source.

This is interesting because shows the loop of requesting the input values
and the results of each processing function computation.
This info is printed through the serial monitor of the mote (be sure
to set DEBUG macro to 1 in /apps/tres/tres-interface.c).

The simulation runs 3 simple TRes nodes and automatically sets up the Halve task
(https://github.com/tecip-nes/contiki-tres/wiki/The-Halve-Task-Example).

== Prerequisites

To use the client-test.sh script you will need libcoap client supporting COAP13.

== How to run it:

Launch the simulation in Cooja (the Halve task will be automatically set up)
    $ make TARGET=cooja tres-test-src.csc >/dev/null

Open a different terminal and tunslip6
    $ make connect-router-cooja

Open a third terminal to simulate the client:
    $ ./client-test.sh get 

You can also use Copper to test out the /no subresource and its behaviour.
